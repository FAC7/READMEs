# Sorted Sets Tutorial

This is a ([drag race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race) inspired) tutorial on redis sorted sets. You'll be setting
up a redis database with node that lets you store and retrieve a list of
contestants, sorted by the episode in which they were eliminated!

### Instructions

The files you will be changing are `redis.js`, `server.js`, and `script.js`.
We've set you up with a basic server. Your job is to add redis functions to
handle posting and getting data from the redis database.

For `server.js`, you will need to finish the handler with the redis functions
you have created.

in `script.js`, the first function is done for you. You need to complete the
`displayData` function, and implement appending the data results to the DOM.
