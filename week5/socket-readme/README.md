# WebSockets

## What are WebSockets?

Websockets provide an always on connection between a client and a server that both parties can use to send data at any time.

## How are they different from HTTP requests?

WebSockets is better for situations that require low-latency communication. For example chat applications or games. This is because to establish a connection between a sever and a client a handshake process is needed. This can be thought of as the computers greeting each other. Both HTTP and WebSockets have equivalent sized initial connection handshakes, but with a WebSocket connection the initial handshake is performed once and then small messages only have 6 bytes of overhead. With a HTTP request the overhead in each message comes from the size of the headers and also from the logic to handle and parse this headers. As a header is required with each message, this makes HTTP very slow compared to sockets.
