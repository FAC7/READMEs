# READMEs

FAC7, please add your READMEs here from now on.

## Checklist for creating READMEs

+ [ ] Pick your topic; keep it small;
+ [ ] Google for tutorials, in particular videos;
+ [ ] Skim the tutorials and pick your favourite;
+ [ ] Time yourself following your favourite tutorial, typing as you go, and estimate the time required to complete it; 
+ [ ] Summarise the tutorial in a single paragraph and link to it;
+ [ ] If there is a code snippet that illustrates the topic, then add it with an explanatory paragraph;
+ [ ] Add an introductory paragraph that describes the *What, Why, How* of the topic;
+ [ ] Add a *Related* section and list any related topics that you think we need READMEs for;
+ [ ] Link the related topics to any READMEs that already exist;
+ [ ] Add a *References* section and link to any other material that you found useful;
+ [ ] Add a nice illustrative diagram or screenshot;
+ [ ] Add your README to the relevant week and give it a sensible name *
+ [ ] **Bonus**: If you don't find any tutorials that you like, create your own (screencasts particularly welcome).

(* Sensible names are all lower-case, do not have spaces or non-ASCII characters and end with the .md file extension)

And keep your explanations short and simple.
