# Accessibility
## What
Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can use the Web.

## Why?
It ensures that people both disabled (visual, auditory, physical speech cognitive and neurological disabilities) and elderly can perceive understand and navigate and interact with the web.
Ensures your website is flexible and meets different user needs, preferences and situations. This is useful not just for
disability but also for those with a slow web connection and people with temporary disabilities like broken limbs.

## Why is it so important?
The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. If these resources are not accessible, you put disabled people at a disadvantage.

* See a description of the social factors at stake in developing web accessibility [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/soc).
* There are in some cases [law and policy](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policy-res) in regard to web accessibility.

## How?
The Web Accessibility Initiative is responsible for developing guidelines and techniques that describe accessibility solutions for Web software and Web developers.
These WAI guidelines are considered the [international standard for Web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components.php).
Think of accessibility from the beginning. Fixing inaccessibility is challenging. [Here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/Overview) is a document that is a basic list of steps for addressing accessibility in projects and also some tips about how to evaluate the
accessibility of a project [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview.html).
