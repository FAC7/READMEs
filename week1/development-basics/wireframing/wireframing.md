# **WIREFRAMING**

## **WHAT IS IT ??**
Wireframing is a step-by-step which gives a web page its structure and basic design. It does not necessarily involve the use of specific content.

## **WHY IT'S GOOD / WHY YOU NEED IT**
Wireframing will allow a designer to ***produce a web-page mockup*** before going straight to coding.

Wireframing allows you to plan for **hierarchy** and **flow of content**, thus influencing the overall user's experience and interaction.
