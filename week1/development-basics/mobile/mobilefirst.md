## Basics of mobile-first design/progressive enhancement, including why this is important

### What

Mobile first design/pregressive enhancement is a responsive design approach. Developers consider content and its arrangement on smaller screens first then add content when designing for larger screens.

### Why

> "1.2 million mobile users worldwide"

Mobile devices support newer, enhanced technologies that are improving and changing all the time. Developers need to consider these capabilities when designing websites.

It helps in deciding on content and layout and allows you to be more concise.

As the viewport size gets smaller screens can become cluttered and require users to zoom into sections on the page.

It's easier to design for mobile first as it forces you to pinpoint the most important content which you can then enhance for larger screens.

Deciding on most important content is also necessary as loading content takes longer for mobile devices that  are less powerful than desktop computers and have lower bandwidth.

### How

*   Create a hierarchy of the most important content.
*   Put more important content near the top of the page
*   choose colours and images that don't affect readbility of contect
*   arrange content one above the other

*   Use font sizes large enough for mobile devices
*   Make buttons large enough for touch screens
