<h2>Paired programming</h2>

<h3>What</h3>

Two programmers at one computer - one types while the other checks the code and makes suggestions.

<h3>Why</h3>

It improves long term productivity and quality of work as errors in code are found earlier on. Knowledge is shared amongst the team - if one member leaves knowledge isn't lost.

<h3>How</h3>

The observer should review the code being written by the programmer, looking out for bugs and thinking about issues such as whether the code accounts for certain values. Also think about design improvements.

Constantly talk through your ideas and what you plan to do next.

Switch roles regularly so that both are kept engaged and gain a full understanding of the code being written.
