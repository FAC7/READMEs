## INTRO

- #### What is Markdown?
  **Markdown** is an *easy-to-use* language, mainly used on the **Github** platform that **converts text** syntax formatting **into html** and rendering it on a page.

- #### Why and where use it?
  * Markdown is a great language to combine **hybrid formats** such as **text** and **code snippets**, highlighting the different formats in a **highly visible** manner (e.g. **colours in Javascript code**).
  * Github **readme files** with the **.md** extension and **Gitter chats** are the most common examples where markdown is used.

## GENERAL GUIDES / TUTORIALS
The following are **great for mastering the basics**.
- Definitely **start with Github's [basic tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)**. It has almost everything you need to get through.
* **Get inspired!** Feel free to **check out** the syntax used in this file and **other readme.md files on Github** for useful insight!!
* Remember you **can also use html directly.** If it makes it more simple you can do it!
* **Google anything you can't find**!

## MORE SPECIFIC FEATURES
- #### EMBEDDING AND ALIGNING IMAGES
 image **description in square brackets** preceded by "!", **url in parentheses**. 
 ```
 ![imgDescription](imageUrl)
 ```

 Be careful about the **sizing and alignment**, you can do so **with hml!**, as I have with the image on top of the page.
 ```

  ```

- #### EMBEDDING CODE / HIGHLIGHTING VARIABLES
  The ``` notation comes very handy.

  ``` x=20 ```

  ```javascript
  var x=999;
  for(i=0;i<x;i++){
    console.log("You are number"+idea);
    //logs the message
  }
  ```
