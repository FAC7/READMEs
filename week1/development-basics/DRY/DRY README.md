This is one of the main principles of software development.
It aims to reduce repetition of information of all kinds.

> “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.”

This principle was formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book *The Pragmatic Programmer*.

## Why?
Duplication can lead to maintenance nightmares, poor factoring, and logical contradictions.
When the DRY principle is applied, the modification
of any single element does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements of a system.

An example of repetition is *CloneAndModifyProgramming* (i.e. cut and paste programming). It is generally the chief culprit.
