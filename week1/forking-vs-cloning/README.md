In both forking and cloning, a copy is made of a repo.

Forking copies a repo from GitHub to GitHub, but under a different
namespace. You can fork a repo when you don't have write permissions
to it. For example if you use the GitHub interface to edit a file on
a repository you can't push to, GitHub will automatically create a
fork of the repo.

One other reason to fork a project is if you want to use it as a
starting point for building your own project.

Cloning copies a repo from GitHub to a local directory. This
means that if you want to be able to work on a repository on your
computer, it needs to be cloned. This could be used for repos you
created, or repos that you have write permissions to. If you forked
a repo and want to make changes to it on your own computer, you
still need to clone it.
