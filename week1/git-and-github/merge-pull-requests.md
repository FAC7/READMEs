# Making & Merging Pull Requests

## What is a pull request (PR)?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary. Crucially, peers can merge work that's been scrutinised and approved by all parties.

## When should you create one?
* When you think you know how an existing   project can be improved.
* When you have additional code resources to offer.
* When you notice a bug or an error.
* If you're feeling pedantic.

## How should you create a PR?
1. Create a new branch (see Liam's gitbranch.md for details)
2. Make changes to the code (see Liam's gitbranch.md for more details)

## How should you request a merge of your PR?
* Click on the repo you'd like to change.
* Select the newly created branch containing fresh changes (commits). ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15245336/12418479/7583131a-bea7-11e5-8b1f-b5732323c119.png)
* Click on the **Compare and Review** button - this will check for any changes to the original code (**Merge Conflicts** see Katherine's merge-conflict-README.md for details).

* You should now be on the **Compare page** - this automatically selects your new and the master branch for merging.
* Click **Create pull request**. ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15245336/12418478/75801d68-bea7-11e5-9403-05b4e0cbd58d.png)
* Briefly describe the change you are making.
* Click **Create pull request** (again!).

***!!NB!! MERGE YOUR OWN PRS AND RISK LOOKING QUITE THE FOOL!!***

## Tips for free
* Be clear And specific.
* Create a separate pull request for each sub-issue of a larger problem.
* Stick to existing conventions - don't change or cramp the original creator's coding style.
* Don't copy-and-paste code - you'll only risk creating more / duplicating bugs.
* Make a judgement call on the error in question - if it's slight (e.g. grammar mistake, missing comma), a message may suffice.
