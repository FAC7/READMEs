# Week 9: Video Topics

There are some awesome resources out there for learning all things React. Soon there will be more - when you publish your tutorials on the Founders & Coders YouTube channel!

As the first port of call for Tuesday, it's important you spend some time reviewing the material from Monday's workshop. We all need to wrap our head around state and props, 'the V in MVC', components, require, the render function, etc, etc. Before lunch, go and check out some of those awesome resources. Google is your friend but if you can't find what you're looking for, these links might be useful:
