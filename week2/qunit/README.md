### What is asynchronus programming?
In programming, we can simplify the definition of synchronous code as “a bunch of statements in sequence”; so each statement in your code is executed one after the other. This means each statement has to wait for the previous one to finish executing.

```javascript
console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');
```
