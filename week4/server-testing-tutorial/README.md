# Server Side Testing

In the test folder, the first test is completed for you in `server.test.js`. The
implementation for the test is in `server.js`. You will need to `npm install tape` and `npm install shot`.

The `server.test.js` file has comments which explain what each part of the code does. Use these to help you complete the task below.

### Your task

Lets say you have a button on your home page that when clicked sends an http
request with a url of /cat. You want to create a test that replicates when
someone clicks on this button. You will need to test that it goes to the specified url.

You can use the already completed test as a guide for writing your own test.
