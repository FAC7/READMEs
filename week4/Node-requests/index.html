  <h1 class='FontBulge'>Setting up a server!</h1>

    <hr>
    <h3><em>What you'll need</em></h3>
    <p>
      Node installed on your machine.
      You won't need to install any additional modules; we'll be using built in modules for this tutorial.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3><em>Complete the following variables in your server.js file:</em></h3>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>var http = ...<br>set this to require the http module. Like this: require('http')</li>

              <em>You need the http module so that you can access some useful methods.</em>

          <li>var port = ...<br>Set this to 'process.env.PORT || 8080'. <br>Let's break this down:
          var port = process.env.PORT means set 'port' to whichever value is stored in the environment variable PORT. (you can see for yourself if you type echo $PORT in your terminal.)<br>
        You might find that $PORT is empty. That's why we use the ||. The value on the right hand side of the '||' is used if $PORT is empty.</li>
          <em>You need to set the port so that the server knows which channel to listen to.</em>
          <li><em>var fs = ...</em></li>
      </p>
    <hr>
    <h3><em>Handler function</em></h3>
    <p>
      Your handler function will be called everytime your browser makes a request to the server. It takes two paramters: request and response. Both are objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The response object includes a key-value pair for the url. The url is set as '/' by default. We check for this in our handler function. When the browser is opened to localhost:8080/ (or localhost:8080) a request is made for our html index.file. A similar check is made for the css file.
    </p>

    <p>
      At line 18 we make a request for to the server if part of the url contains '/new_request'. Complete the gaps in the if statement.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h3><em>http createServer() method</em></h3>
    <p>
      This method takes a callback function which is executed everytime a new request is made. Our callback function is the handler function above.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Complete the code on line 26.
    </p>
    <hr>
      <h3><em>Run your server</em></h3>
      <p>
        cd to the folder you've been working in and enter the following command in your terminal:
      </p>
      <p>
        node server.js
      </p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class='result'><em>Final result : Click on the button to make a GET request. (I know you can do it)</h3>
    <a href='/new_request'><button>CLICK</button></a>
