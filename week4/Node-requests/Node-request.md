# Node Request

## What

You can make HTTP requests to your server using the Node.js api: ```html.request```

## How

A request message to your server takes the following format:


* A __Request-line__

* Zero or more header fields followed by CRLF

* An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF)
indicating the end of the header fields

* message-body [optional]

### More on the Request-line

The request-line consists of 3 things:
 - a method e.g. GET
 - the URI
 - the protocol and its version e.g. HTTP/1.1
