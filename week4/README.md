# Learning Outcomes

## Node Core

* Investigate the 'http' core module and its methods

* Once the Readme is complete, create one or more tutorials* which highlight one or more of these topics.

## Node Request

* What are some of the useful properties of the request object? [method, url, statusCode]
* Once the Readme is complete, create a simple server tutorial that creates a http.request to receive some form of data. (anything from simple html to api data)

## Node Stream

* What are streams (createReadStream) and what would you use them for?
* Once the Readme is complete, create one or more tutorials* which highlight one or more of these topics.
For example you could create a simple server tutorial that converts a csv file into a txt file and moves it from the root folder of this tutorial to a folder called text

## Node Routing

* Once the Readme is complete, create a Tutorial to setup pre-commit hooks
    * Linter/syntax pre-commit hook
    * another one of your choice. :smile:

## Server Side testing

* What is server side testing?
* How does npm module tape work?
* What other kind of tests would you want to write for Node?
* What is nodemon?
* Once the Readme is complete, create a simple server tutorial that uses tape for tests

## Test Coverage

* What is Istanbul?
