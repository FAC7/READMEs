##Authentication week: Before the darkness falls.

This week you are learning about authentication.

##Authentication project: Cometh the hour, cometh the oAuth.

- Do oAuth using one of the following APIs: github or twitter or facebook (check whats possible with each before you decide).
- We want you to create a user session, storing a JWT (so that the naked access token isn't being transferred across insecure http) in a cookie.
- Try that your server is making some GET and POST requests to your chosen API (extra scopes might be required).

###Stretch goals:

- Log out button which ends user session.
- Use a database (probably redis, let's face it) to store some user credentials (either user generated or brought in from chosen API).

*Hasta la vista*
