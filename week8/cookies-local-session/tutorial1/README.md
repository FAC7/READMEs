Tutorial 1 - basic setting and checking cookies

In this tutorial you will using a custom plugin called cookiesPlugin.js. The aim is to check for an existing cookie when the user arrives at the home page.  If the user has never visited the page before, a welcome message will appear and a cookie will be set.  If it is a returning user, a welcome back message will appear.


First look at the server.js file, where we register the cookiesPlugin.js plugin.

Next complete the cookiesPlugin.js file.
